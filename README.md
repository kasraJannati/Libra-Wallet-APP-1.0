## Facebook 
Currently, FB doesn't provide full API to implement web-wallet, I will run on a server + service to map client requests to CLI commands.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```
